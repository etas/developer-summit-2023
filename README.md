# What is next!

At the summit you had the chance to win an ESP32 Development Board.

This particular board was used in one of the showcases called SDV2Go as a remote control.

Around exactly this Development Board we will now post various  challenges over the following month to bring some of the ETAS topics close to you.

We hope you will take the chance and opportunity to engage with us on these challenges.
